## Comprehensive US Sales Analysis and Dashboard
- ## Overview

  - This project involves a detailed analysis of US regional sales data to uncover actionable insights and trends. The goal was to understand sales patterns, channel performance, and profitability by performing data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The analysis aimed to provide strategic insights into sales performance and optimize decision-making processes.

  ### Process

  - **Data Source:** The analysis utilized the US Regional Sales Data, which includes sales transactions across various channels with 17,992 rows and 15 columns.
  - **Tools:** MySQL Workbench for data manipulation and Google Sheets for dashboard creation.
  - **Data Cleaning:** Included creating a database, adjusting data types, formatting dates, and validating data. Calculated fields such as TotalRevenue, TotalCost, Profit, and DiscountedRevenue were added.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Addressed key questions about revenue and profit by sales channel, monthly trends, and top customers/products.
  - **Data Analysis:** Advanced SQL queries were used to perform revenue and profit analysis, identify trends, and calculate key metrics.
  - **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations including a comprehensive dashboard, pie charts, bar charts, and area line graphs to effectively communicate insights.

## Global Air Pollution Analysis and Dashboard
- ## Overview

  - This project analyzes historical air quality data from 2010 to 2017 for 240 countries, focusing on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter). The goal is to identify trends, visualize patterns, and understand variations in global air pollution across different countries and time periods.

- ## Process

  - **Data Source:** The analysis utilized the PM2.5 Global Air Pollution 2010-2017 dataset from Kaggle.
  - **Tools:** MySQL Workbench for data manipulation and Tableau for dashboard creation.
  - **Data Cleaning:** Imported the dataset into MySQL Workbench and created a table for PM2.5 data. Data types were adjusted, and data transformation was performed to convert the dataset from a wide format to a long format. Missing values were handled, and data validation was completed to ensure accuracy.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Addressed key questions about average PM2.5 levels by country, variations by year, and geographic distribution of pollution levels.
  - **Data Analysis:** Utilized advanced SQL queries to calculate average PM2.5 levels, track changes over time, and identify countries with significant increases or decreases in pollution levels.
  - **Data Visualization:** Developed interactive visualizations in Tableau, including a color-coded map, line graph, and bar chart to effectively present trends, comparisons, and insights.
